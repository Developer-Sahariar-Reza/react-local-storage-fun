# react-local-storage-fun


Basic local storage fun with react. In this project I made 3 components. I used Vanilla CSS. 
In Movie component I fetch data from my local api in public folder. 
In Card component I design the movie container. I display the data in card. Here I used react font awesome version 6.4.0
In Cart component I design the cart container.

When you click on the watch now button in My cart section the watch time will updated. You will see the updated number in the input box. The updated number will be saved in local storage.
You can select one break time button. When you click the button other buttons will not be disabled but the number in input box will change into 15 or 25 nor 35. The break time will be saved in local storage.
When you click the complete button you will see an alert. The alert will show you the total watch time. The total watch time is calculated by total watch time - total break time. The alert is made by react toastify.
